## 3. Pricing Calculation Logic

### 3.1 Pricing Resolution Order

```
1. Check for Company Customer Product Pricing (most specific)
   ↓ (if not found)
2. Check for Company Customer Pricing (corporate pricing)
   ↓ (if not found)
3. Check for Volume Discount Rules
   ↓ (if not found)
4. Check for Pricing Tier (company-specific)
   ↓ (if not found)
5. Check for Pricing Tier (platform-wide)
   ↓ (if not found)
6. Use Base Product Price
```

### 3.2 Calculation Example

**Scenario**: Company A (seller) selling to Company B (buyer), Product X, Quantity: 25

1. **Base Price**: $100
2. **Company Customer Product Pricing**: None
3. **Company Customer Pricing**: 15% discount for Company B
4. **Volume Discount**: 10+ units = 5% additional discount
5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Apply corporate discount: $100 × 0.85 = $85
   - Apply volume discount: $85 × 0.95 = $80.75
   - Total for 25 units: $80.75 × 25 = $2,018.75

## 7. Technical Considerations
 
### 7.1 Integration Boundaries

- Use existing Catalog v2 endpoints for all marketplace data and pricing reads:
  - `GET /api/products/{id}/catalog` (`routes/api.php:60-128`).
  - `POST /api/products/{id}/bundles/{bundleId}/price` (`routes/api.php:228-383`).
- Protect admin writes and maintenance operations via `auth:sanctum` + `api.auth`:
  - Variant generation `POST /api/products/{id}/variants/generate` (`routes/api.php:227`) with role checks (`routes/api.php:152-155`).
- Company panel pages follow `web` + `auth` under `account/*` with menu inclusion:
  - Sidebar include `resources/views/sections/menu.blade.php:237-239` using `craveva_plugins()` (`app/Helper/start.php:382-395`).
  - Visibility gated by `user_modules()` (`app/Helper/start.php:328-379`) and `module_enabled()` (`app/Helper/start.php:609-627`).

### 7.2 Pricing Metadata Propagation

- Documents (Estimates, Orders, Invoices) carry a single `pricing_metadata` JSON per line item containing:
  - Bundle selection IDs, option item IDs, and final price breakdown.
  - Source computation reference (e.g., `POST /api/.../price` response hash).
- Benefits:
  - Avoids immediate schema changes; keeps auditability and UAT transparency.
  - Enables display of savings and composition in downstream PDFs and UIs.

### 7.1 Performance
- Cache pricing calculations
- Index database tables properly
- Use eager loading for relationships
- Consider Redis for pricing cache

### 7.2 Data Integrity
- Validate pricing rules don't conflict
- Ensure pricing tiers are active and valid
- Check validity periods
- Handle edge cases (expired tiers, inactive products)

### 7.3 Scalability
- Support thousands of pricing tiers
- Handle complex pricing rules efficiently
- Optimize pricing calculation queries
- Consider background jobs for bulk pricing updates

### 7.4 Security
- Restrict pricing tier management to authorized users
- Validate company ownership
- Audit pricing changes
- Protect against pricing manipulation

---

## 8. Migration Strategy

### 8.1 Data Migration
- Migrate existing discount logic to pricing tiers
- Preserve existing proposal/order pricing
- Create default pricing tiers for existing companies

### 8.2 Backward Compatibility
- Maintain existing discount fields in invoices/proposals
- Support both old and new pricing systems during transition
- Gradual migration of existing data

---

## 9. Success Metrics

- **Adoption Rate**: % of companies using pricing tiers
- **Pricing Accuracy**: % of orders with correct pricing
- **Performance**: Pricing calculation time < 100ms
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on pricing features
- **Revenue Impact**: Increase in B2B sales

---

## 10. Future Enhancements

- **Dynamic Pricing**: AI-based pricing optimization
- **A/B Testing**: Test different pricing strategies
- **Price History**: Track pricing changes over time
- **Bulk Pricing Updates**: Update pricing for multiple products
- **Pricing Analytics**: Dashboard with pricing insights
- **Multi-Currency Pricing**: Different pricing per currency
- **Time-Based Pricing**: Different pricing at different times
- **Geographic Pricing**: Different pricing by location

---

## 11. Risk Mitigation

### 11.1 Technical Risks
- **Complex Pricing Rules**: Use clear priority system
- **Performance Issues**: Implement caching and optimization
- **Data Conflicts**: Validation and conflict resolution

### 11.2 Business Risks
- **Pricing Errors**: Comprehensive testing and validation
- **User Confusion**: Clear UI and documentation
- **Revenue Impact**: Gradual rollout with monitoring

---

## 12. Conclusion

This B2B pricing system will transform Craveva into a powerful B2B marketplace platform, enabling:
- Flexible, customizable pricing for companies
- Automated volume discounts
- Corporate pricing relationships
- Seamless integration with existing deals and proposals
- Scalable architecture for future growth

The phased implementation approach ensures minimal disruption while delivering value incrementally.
